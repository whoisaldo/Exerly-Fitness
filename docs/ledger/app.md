# App agent ledger (Astra)

Read AGENT_BRIEF.md, this ledger and to-app.md after every reset. Done is not
met. No parity row is fully device-verified. Continue without ending at a
milestone. Current date 2026-10-06, updated 15:54 EDT.

## Current work and next steps

2026-10-06 16:43 EDT. Done is not met. A3 remains the live internal release,
build 2610061942. A4 is frozen in this app-next worktree, branch agent/app-next,
source bd6225eb after rebasing onto integration 69fac1e4.

The first complete A4 suite passed at 16:33 EDT, 112 hosted + 22 UI tests,
8 optional skips, zero failures. Evidence is artifacts/agents/full-a4-native.
Logic landed a plate fix during that run, so the required final suite on the
rebased source is running again, full-a4-canonical, session 81938, started 16:35.
Do not interrupt it. Final Core 220, API 226 and device build pass in canonical-
{core,api,device}.log. Full suite uses Original Large 7189880A and fixture 39203.

Signed archive and IPA 2610062038 passed validation on this rebased source,
apps/ios/build/release/2610062038. They are NOT uploaded. Earlier 2005 is now
obsolete and must not be uploaded. After the final suite passes, upload 2038,
then run artifacts/agents/finalize-internal.mjs with a4-test-notes.txt. Verify
VALID, IN_BETA_TESTING, the Ali-only group and notes. Update PARITY/RELEASE and
fast-forward integration. Logic was asked to hold further integration at69fac1e4.

All four largest-text agent review variants pass, and all images are inspected.
All four updated export variants pass too; all24 captures are inspected in
artifacts/agents/export-{small,large}-{light,dark}. No new clipping. The A4 review
found unsupported program proposals; A5 now explains this before Accept/Undo.
A4 notes disclose that only workout/exercise decisions are supported.

Primary /Users/aldo/Desktop/Exerly-Fitness-app, branch agent/app, now carries
A5 at68c7ce44 on this A4 base. Do not put those changes into this release.
TrainingEntryChecks runs Core in background, preserves manual logging, caches
completed snapshots, refuses late results after account close or edits, and
files reviewable proposals. Observations uses Core findings and links to raw
sets/source workouts, showing missing RIR/bodyweight and unverifiable metrics.
23 focused hosted tests pass. All three normal UI journeys pass across
real-api-ready and checks-off-control; the initial toggle failure was a test
tap on the label, corrected to hit the switch. All20 normal captures inspected.
A5 largest-type small-light/session18961 and large-dark/session4393 are running
in primary/artifacts/insights. Then run small-dark and large-light and inspect.
Logic has a new medium wording finding: declining estimates are described as
"hasn't moved". Adopt its exact Core correction for A5 when published.

Fixtures: app-next39203/4/5; primary39206/session44454 and39207/session85413.
Use TEST_RUNNER_EXERLY_UI_FIXTURE_URL for XCTest runner, not SIMCTL_CHILD.
Only app simulators are used; no protected services changed.

Continue A5, then A6 design010 and the rest of parity. Do not stop at a milestone.

## A3 final evidence and release

- `artifacts/account/full-a3-canonical.xcresult`:100 hosted +19 UI pass,
  eight opt-in skips, zero failures. Completed15:47 EDT. API219/Core183/device
  pass in canonical-{api,core,device}.log. Lint/format/typecheck/SwiftLint pass
  in canonical-* logs. Existing warnings only. Six Node/seven Python release
  checks pass in final-release-* logs; release scripts unchanged since.
- Four final largest-type account variants pass, two journeys each. All36
  screenshots inspected in account/{small-light-final,small-dark-final,
  large-light-final,large-dark-final}. Earlier32 recovery +11 normal captures
  also inspected. Banner and Start workout wrap fixes verified.
- Earlier full-a3-current had one legacy test-hook port failure, fixed and
  focused verified. full-a3-final was interrupted to adopt700cdc0d. Neither
  is the final evidence; full-a3-canonical is green.
- Signed archive/IPA1942 passed validation. Upload success15:49 EDT.
  `apps/ios/build/release/2610061942/{Exerly.xcarchive,export/Exerly.ipa,upload.log}`.
  Obsolete1907 and1727 must not be uploaded. Upload session49030 finished.

A3 native Apple buttons validate nonce/state/token and call the shared Core
bridge. Account methods link/unlink, Apple-only guard, export/share, explicit
reauth/deletion. AppAccountWorkspace shuts down Core sync before account
changes, consumes persistent confirmed cleanup queue and resumes sync after
failed deletion. Training persistence is account-specific; hosts training+agent.
Automatic foreground/120sec sync. Account export merges unsynced training and
proposals; offline export works. UI discloses pending legacy rows excluded.
Core now supplies queue export and explicit persistence close; wire into A4.

Root account notices sit above auth/TabView so they do not cover Back on iOS18.
Saved-account banner describes cached details rather than incorrectly declaring
training offline. Welcome uses original mark, scrolling/Reduce Motion, wrapping
copy and opaque auth back button. Start workout wraps at largest type.

## A4 implementation and evidence

Design008 and tests preceded implementation. Four Features/Agents files, two
hosted test files, project registration, Profile Connected agents and Training
Suggestions entry are in app-next. AgentReviewModel uses Core accept/reject/undo,
including stale/invalid refusal and sync of refusal audits. Full field diffs,
unit presentation, raw JSON fallback, verified/mismatch/unavailable metrics,
evidence/caveats/confidence/falsifier, offline decisions and activity history.
Stale refusal scrolls into view and receives VoiceOver focus.

Tokens use account-bound API. Default read+propose; read-only available; direct
write requires explicit native alert with Cancel. Secret masked until Show,
copy is local-device-only with ten-minute expiry, clear on Close/disappear,
hide on background and discard a creation completing after Close. Revocation
requires confirmation and remains reflected if the subsequent refresh fails.
Permission label wraps through Menu/Picker, fixed37299a9d.

- Eight hosted tests pass, including actual store decisions and token races.
- Real-server UI: offline accept/relaunch/sync/undo/reject/audit; stale proposal
  preserves later workout edit; token default/masking/revoke/cancel/direct-write
  cancellation. No token secrets printed or exposed in test captures.
- Normal SE three journeys pass across real-api-first/offline-navigation-fixed;
  all13 images inspected.
- large-dark-scroll and large-light-canonical: eight hosted+three UI pass.
  All13 and14 images inspected. Permission picker clipping found, fixed37299.
- small-light-canonical review failed only upward gesture after undo. Helper
  now drags inside visible list below account banner (4d89933a). Not passing
  evidence. All13 captures inspected.
- small-light-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- large-dark-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- large-light-permission-final: focused connection journey passes; all5 images
  inspected. Completes verification of picker correction in light mode.
- small-dark-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- Device build passes after picker fix in agents/permission-device.log.
- Full native A4 suite active as listed above; A4 TestFlight pending.

Native alerts remain scrollable at largest type; test both Cancel and confirm.
Exercise evidence links currently explain unavailable; A5 will link to logged sets.

## Logic handoffs and reviews

Logic worktree /Users/aldo/Desktop/Exerly-Fitness-logic, last seen branchlogic/next
at7ba4f44e. It waits for A3 landing before M4/M5. App must not edit Core/API.
Integration /Users/aldo/Desktop/Exerly-Fitness is merge-only, never edit files.
App writes docs/handoff/to-logic.md in primary and logic worktree for timely review.

Reviewed migrated UUID issue; exactfix700cdc0d adopted into A3/A4. Reviewed
M4 weightMatch inert toggle: Logic explicitly reserves it now, omit from UI.
New medium plate finding: greedy80kg/bar20/25pair1+15pairs2 returns70 despite80
achievable; target10/bar20 reports zero shortfall. Reproduction in
artifacts/app-review-plates/result.log. Inbox asks best combination and clear
below-bar outcome including warm-ups. A4 remote4e696163 review requested.

Available contracts on logic/next, not yet integrated:

  for that path. Use close on switch/signout. Reads/writes after close throw.
- ecccb9fd AccountExport.merging(... pending: try SyncEngine.shared.pendingExportRows()).
  Overlays all legacy queue entries/deletions with pending_sync; remove exclusion
  copy. Adopt hosted attachment docs/handoff/attachments/LegacyExportTests.swift.

  evidence, reject/undo wins. App A5 design009 uses this unchanged API.
- ProgramStore + ProgramSchedule nextWorkout/lifecycle/overrides, sync and agent
  host support. A6 design010, omit reserved weightMatch and await plate fix.
- NutritionStore domains, energy-balance/trend estimates. Targets/search/import
  still forthcoming from Logic; no nutrition UI started yet.
