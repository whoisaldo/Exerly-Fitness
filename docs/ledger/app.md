# App agent ledger (Astra)

Read AGENT_BRIEF.md, this ledger and to-app.md after every reset. Done is not
met. No parity row is fully device-verified. Continue without ending at a
milestone. Current date 2026-10-06, updated 15:54 EDT.

## Current work and next steps

2026-10-06 17:19 EDT. Done is not met. A4 is live internally as build
2610062038, VALID and IN_BETA_TESTING, English notes verified, only Ali and only
this build assigned. Upload succeeded 17:11. Build UUID
c637f92f-fd07-4296-9545-60ea744fed2c. Finalizer result is
artifacts/agents/a4-internal-release.json. A3 1942 is detached; never upload
obsolete A4 2005.

Final A4 suite full-a4-canonical passed at 17:09, 112 hosted + 22 UI tests,
eight optional skips, zero failures. Core 220, API 226 and device build pass.
All four largest-type review/export variants and all captures inspected.
Source bd6225eb on integration 69fac1e4. Landing A4 now after docs update.

A5 remains in primary agent/app. Small-dark and large-light passed 23 hosted
and three UI journeys each. Latest large-dark targeted UI2/UI3 runs on original
large simulator, session 43394, fixture39203. Small-light UI1 from scroll and
UI2 from off-final pass. Need updated UI3 captures after changes, inspect every
final named capture, then full suite/device and internal release.

Logic published fixes 0b3126ea (falling-lift wording), e09b7ac6 (program lifecycle
preview) and 5fe8a435 (recent entry checks). Adopt into the appropriate milestone.
A5 medium review: continue filing later proposals after one fails, retain visible
error and explicit retry. Update tests before releasing. Logic still holds
integration until A4 lands; inform it when merged.

A6 isolated worktree Exerly-Fitness-app-programs, branch agent/app-programs,
f74a3d9b. ProgramStore composition and six real-store draft/plan tests pass.
New TrainingProgramEditor.swift is uncommitted and unregistered; next wire list,
lifecycle confirmations using Core preview, next-workout review/start and UI tests.
No network or domain maths in screens. Preserve original purple/pink theme.

Continue A5, A6 and the rest of parity. Do not stop at a milestone.

## A3 final evidence and release

- `artifacts/account/full-a3-canonical.xcresult`:100 hosted +19 UI pass,
  eight opt-in skips, zero failures. Completed15:47 EDT. API219/Core183/device
  pass in canonical-{api,core,device}.log. Lint/format/typecheck/SwiftLint pass
  in `canonical-*` logs. Existing warnings only. Six Node/seven Python release
  checks pass in `final-release-*` logs; release scripts unchanged since.
- Four final largest-type account variants pass, two journeys each. All36
  screenshots inspected in account/{small-light-final,small-dark-final,
  large-light-final,large-dark-final}. Earlier32 recovery +11 normal captures
  also inspected. Banner and Start workout wrap fixes verified.
- Earlier full-a3-current had one legacy test-hook port failure, fixed and
  focused verified. full-a3-final was interrupted to adopt700cdc0d. Neither
  is the final evidence; full-a3-canonical is green.
- Signed archive/IPA1942 passed validation. Upload success15:49 EDT.
  `apps/ios/build/release/2610061942/{Exerly.xcarchive,export/Exerly.ipa,upload.log}`.
  Obsolete1907 and1727 must not be uploaded. Upload session49030 finished.

A3 native Apple buttons validate nonce/state/token and call the shared Core
bridge. Account methods link/unlink, Apple-only guard, export/share, explicit
reauth/deletion. AppAccountWorkspace shuts down Core sync before account
changes, consumes persistent confirmed cleanup queue and resumes sync after
failed deletion. Training persistence is account-specific; hosts training+agent.
Automatic foreground/120sec sync. Account export merges unsynced training and
proposals; offline export works. UI discloses pending legacy rows excluded.
Core now supplies queue export and explicit persistence close; wire into A4.

Root account notices sit above auth/TabView so they do not cover Back on iOS18.
Saved-account banner describes cached details rather than incorrectly declaring
training offline. Welcome uses original mark, scrolling/Reduce Motion, wrapping
copy and opaque auth back button. Start workout wraps at largest type.

## A4 implementation and evidence

Design008 and tests preceded implementation. Four Features/Agents files, two
hosted test files, project registration, Profile Connected agents and Training
Suggestions entry are in app-next. AgentReviewModel uses Core accept/reject/undo,
including stale/invalid refusal and sync of refusal audits. Full field diffs,
unit presentation, raw JSON fallback, verified/mismatch/unavailable metrics,
evidence/caveats/confidence/falsifier, offline decisions and activity history.
Stale refusal scrolls into view and receives VoiceOver focus.

Tokens use account-bound API. Default read+propose; read-only available; direct
write requires explicit native alert with Cancel. Secret masked until Show,
copy is local-device-only with ten-minute expiry, clear on Close/disappear,
hide on background and discard a creation completing after Close. Revocation
requires confirmation and remains reflected if the subsequent refresh fails.
Permission label wraps through Menu/Picker, fixed37299a9d.

- Eight hosted tests pass, including actual store decisions and token races.
- Real-server UI: offline accept/relaunch/sync/undo/reject/audit; stale proposal
  preserves later workout edit; token default/masking/revoke/cancel/direct-write
  cancellation. No token secrets printed or exposed in test captures.
- Normal SE three journeys pass across real-api-first/offline-navigation-fixed;
  all13 images inspected.
- large-dark-scroll and large-light-canonical: eight hosted+three UI pass.
  All13 and14 images inspected. Permission picker clipping found, fixed37299.
- small-light-canonical review failed only upward gesture after undo. Helper
  now drags inside visible list below account banner (4d89933a). Not passing
  evidence. All13 captures inspected.
- small-light-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- large-dark-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- large-light-permission-final: focused connection journey passes; all5 images
  inspected. Completes verification of picker correction in light mode.
- small-dark-final: all three UI pass; all14 images inspected.
- Device build passes after picker fix in agents/permission-device.log.
- Full native A4 suite active as listed above; A4 TestFlight pending.

Native alerts remain scrollable at largest type; test both Cancel and confirm.
Exercise evidence links currently explain unavailable; A5 will link to logged sets.

## Logic handoffs and reviews

Logic worktree /Users/aldo/Desktop/Exerly-Fitness-logic, last seen branchlogic/next
at7ba4f44e. It waits for A3 landing before M4/M5. App must not edit Core/API.
Integration /Users/aldo/Desktop/Exerly-Fitness is merge-only, never edit files.
App writes docs/handoff/to-logic.md in primary and logic worktree for timely review.

Reviewed migrated UUID issue; exactfix700cdc0d adopted into A3/A4. Reviewed
M4 weightMatch inert toggle: Logic explicitly reserves it now, omit from UI.
New medium plate finding: greedy80kg/bar20/25pair1+15pairs2 returns70 despite80
achievable; target10/bar20 reports zero shortfall. Reproduction in
artifacts/app-review-plates/result.log. Inbox asks best combination and clear
below-bar outcome including warm-ups. A4 remote4e696163 review requested.

Available contracts on logic/next, not yet integrated:

- b9736776 SQLiteTrainingPersistence.close(); deleteDatabase closes all instances
  for that path. Use close on switch/signout. Reads/writes after close throw.
- ecccb9fd AccountExport.merging(... pending: try SyncEngine.shared.pendingExportRows()).
  Overlays all legacy queue entries/deletions with pending_sync; remove exclusion
  copy. Adopt hosted attachment docs/handoff/attachments/LegacyExportTests.swift.

  evidence, reject/undo wins. App A5 design009 uses this unchanged API.
- ProgramStore + ProgramSchedule nextWorkout/lifecycle/overrides, sync and agent
  host support. A6 design010, omit reserved weightMatch and await plate fix.
- NutritionStore domains, energy-balance/trend estimates. Targets/search/import
  still forthcoming from Logic; no nutrition UI started yet.

## User corrections and credentials

Ali rejected mint/green. Preserve original purple/pink, neutral dark, dark default,
existing purple E/pulse mark. Profile can select Light/System. Icon source
apps/ios/Brand/ExerlyMark.png; render-icon.swift sizes it. No brand redesign.

Old1633 could not sign in to incompatible DO API. Live1654 uses working staging
